WorkFlow

1. Save data into a Map: drug_name -> input_object(which consists of multiple fields of interest)
2. Sort Entries of the map based on total_cost
3. Print the result into a txt file

The default data structure I use in python: list (As Array is not valid option for python)
I implement the following data structure:
1. Linked-List
2. HashSet
3. Trie(Map)
